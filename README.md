# FSSA
Contains two codes
FSSA.m --> for Frequency Domain Singular Spectrum Analysis of 1D time series data:

Singlar Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is an efficient tool being used to decompose the non-linear signals for identifying principal processes and periodicities for physical interpretation (Golyandina and Zhigljavsky, 2013; Tiwari and Rajesh, 2014; Rajesh et al., 2014). 

The code presenetd here is a modified version of time domain SSA code discussed in Tiwari, R. K., & Rekapalli, R. (2020). Singular Spectrum Analysis with MATLABÂ®. In Modern Singular Spectral-Based Denoising and Filtering Techniques for 2D and 3D Reflection Seismic Data (pp. 125-138). Springer, Cham.

Users can follow the guidelines discussed in Tiwari and Rekapalli (2020) to optimally run the code for different datasets. 
GPS_TEC_cm_fiel_Import ---> Import and filter the TEC data file obtained from the *.Cmn file ( obtained from the  TEC processing of RINEX data files from the various GNSS networks were performed using software developed by Gopi Krishna Seemala, Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG))
